# Discord-Template
Easy to see discord template for a discord.js bot.

# Information
This is a very simple template for `Discord.js` || `npm i discord.js` This is meant to give you a starting feel on how to use Discord. There is no fancy stuff going on and probably the easiest way to learn and feel discord. This package allows you to modify the status of the bot and see if you can make your own simple text commands. I have added 3 commands which 2 of them are without a prefix. How-ever there is also a command that works with a prefix. All sections of the package are explained in the green lines or gray depending on which program you are using to look at it. 

# Setup
1. Clone this repository || download it.
2. run the following commands
  1. `npm init`
  2. `npm i discord.js`
3. You can now go into `json/config.json` and replace the token / prefix to yours
4. You can run the bot with `node .`
5. profit
